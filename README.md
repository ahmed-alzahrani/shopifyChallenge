# Shopify Challenge 2019

## Problem / Requirements

__Question 1__: Please design a server-side web API that models the following simple relationship:

- Shops have many Products
- Shops have many Orders
- Products have many Items
- Orders have many Items

(Items refer to any service or product added to an order, along with the quantity and price that pertain to them).

__Requirements per type__:

- Products, Items, and Orders all have a dollar value

- The value of an item should map to the value of the product that the item represents.

- The total value of an order should equal the sum of the value of it's items

__Extra Credit__:

- Supporting full CRUD operations
- Extending the base functionality in interesting ways
- Making your API at least partly secure
- Writing documentation that doesn't suck
- Building the API using GraphQL

__Extra EXTRA credit__:
- Deploy the web API you have created to a Kubernetes environment that is publicly accessible.

## My API

Imagine for a moment, an apocalyptic future, one in which the various technologies developers and companies use to create software are no longer freely available on the web, but rather hidden behind pay-walls, and only downloadable upon purchase.

Gone are the days of enterprising young programmers toying around freely with the latest web framework, or hybrid mobile application SDK. Rather, there exists a number of authorized software distributors that sell  software to end-users at a price.

As horrible as this reality may seem to those of us with a passion for programming, my sample API is modeled in such a future, and around one such authorized software distributor:
